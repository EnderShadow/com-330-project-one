      Hi, I'm Matthew Warren. I'm computer science student at Illinois Tech and will be graduating in May, 2020. I've always been into computers since since I was young. I first got
      into how computers worked when I saw my dad opening up his computer to fix something inside it. I also first got interested in programming when I was younger because I wanted
      to be able to make video games so that I could create an immersive game that let you do almost anything. Of course I now know that making video games isn't that easy.
    </p>

      I first started programming in early middle school by teaching myself C++ from some online tutorials. I didn't get very far in it before I stopped though. It wasn't until a
      year or two later that I started programming again. This time it was in Java because I wanted to make mods for the well known game Minecraft. That was where I really started
      learning programming and I haven't stopped learning since. As of now I know a little bit about a lot of things related to computers, from how they're built at the logic gate
      level all the way to how cloud services work. Of course my knowledge in some areas is very basic or I only have a general idea of how it works, but it's fun to learn about
      this kind of stuff.
    </p>

      My main ambition for this class is that I'll learn how to make a well-designed website so that I can make a website for myself. Another reason I'm taking this class is because
      it counts as a humanities elective and I won't have to write any papers. I'm not a big fan of writing papers.
    </p>

      I already have a job offer from where I interned over the summer for after I graduate in May so I'm not worried about what I'll do after I graduate.
